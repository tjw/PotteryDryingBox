 TODO:
 - Maybe add an initial soak period once reaching the target temperature range (to allow the heat to penetrate the clay)... heading period might be long enough for this to happen naturally.
 - Actually obey the min/max heat and turn the heater off while above the minimum... will have to see if this is worth done once I see the temp/humidity drop from a fan cycle.

// NOTE: In full-on heating test with empty box, covered up with towels, it took from 2014-02-20T16:07:18-08:00 to 2014-02-20T17:35:30-08:00 to go from 40.0 to 42.0.

// Uncomment one of these sections. The exact needed target seems to depend on the amount of clay in the box too.
// Case: A small slab with a target of 40ยบ/75% never reached 75% humdity and came out leather hard
// Case: A medium bowl (~1.5kg) and small solid pyramid (~250g) came out nearly dry.
// Case: A large slab built object kept the humidity at 99.9% for a long time and then stopped getting readings from the temp/humidity. Unclear if the connector was bad or if the sensor hates being that humid for a long time. Redid the connector (which had a loose-ish wire) and dried out the box a bit).
// TODO: Hook up a switch of some sort or programmable level selector

//Targets Target(40.0, 75.0);
//Targets Target(38.0, 65.0); // Still too high for a small slab
//Targets Target(35.0, 55.0); // Pretty dry, but still not bone dry
//Targets Target(35.0, 30.0); // Got bone dry on a small slab

// Trying large slab built container
